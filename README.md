#### üìΩ Gif-in [GitHub Repo Front](https://github.com/okorkov/go-gif) | [Website](https://gifin.co/) 
A simple video to gif converted made during my time working at Linkedin for a convenience of displaying dynamic content in READMEs for pull requests. The main goal while creating it was to make it fast and efficient, no settings or choosing FPS as on most other platforms, gif-in was designed to convert video to gif gifhub friendly that will have a 1000px resulution and has a dynamic FPS based on the video's length (higher FPS for shorter videos). Under the hood I'm using ffmpeg library for processing videos.

#### üì≤ QR-menu.rest [GitHub Repo Front](https://github.com/okorkov/qr-menu-frontend) | [GitHub Repo Back](https://github.com/okorkov/qr-menu-backend)
qr-menu.rest is an online platform that was designed for bars and restaurants to freely host their menus on the cloud with generated QR code that points at it, however, there are no limitations on who can use it. During the pandemic many restaurants switched from paper menus to digital and planning to keep using them since it is more convenient to make changes, more eco-friendly, and less expensive to maintain. There are a few other similar services out there but the significant difference is that qr-menu.rest is free of charge! That's right, as the hospitality industry struggled throughout covid, this platform been created with the intention of supporting bars and restaurants by giving them an ability to host their QR menus for free.
